    little about me: I am a third year student in Northeastern university studying computer science and business administration.
    In my spare time I enjoy playing tennis with friends and I also loves video games. In the future I would like to create my own
    business, which is also why I value computer science and business so much and I am looking forward to learn more about data visualization in this course!
